    <h3>Bio</h3>
         <h4>I’m a designer, an artist, a writer and even a bit of a re-searcher.</h4>
           
         <p id ="text" >I guess you could say I am an experimentalist at heart. There is nothing I love more than working at the intersections of fields, disciplines, knowledge systems, and methodologies. </p>
         <p id ="text"> I have a Bachelors of Environmental Design from the University of British Columbia. My degree allowed me to delve into the intersections of built and natural environment, studying 
             architecture and landscape architecture, but also ecology, conservation and science. </p>
        <p id ="text">I am currently living as a 2.5 generational chinese settler on the unceded ancestral lands of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓  and Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim-speaking peoples (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, and səl̓ilw̓ətaʔɬ), also known as Vancouver, Canada. </p>

        <h3>Bonus</h3>
        
       <h4>A fun question and a fun fact</h4>
       <p id ="text">Why is your username abcsouper? </p> 
       <p id ="text">When I was in Singapore, I stayed with my friend’s cousins. 
        Their grandma (ahma) would come over and make us food. One day she served a soup with carrots, large pieces of corn cobs and pork. This was abc soup! (Name after the vitamins the soup supposedly provides) </p> 
        <p id ="text">Meanwhile in Asia, I was also reflecting on my lived experiences of being born and raised in America and Canada. 
            living in Asia, I became hyper aware of how I really was a hybrid, third-culture kid of sorts. 
            It was kind of confusing, kind of mixed up - like soup!</p>
        <p id ="text">Before meeting this soup, I associated abc with the alphabet, and the acronym - american born chinese (abc). Like me. So abc soup spoke to me in this moment. </p>
        <p id ="text">And I became abcsouper.</p>

        <h4>Special thanks</h4>
        <p id ="text">Special thanks. I stand on the shoulders, lean on the shoulders and rub shoulders with my community, family and friends. 
            <br>
            <br>As I have been putting together this website, and portfolio, I have been able to reflect on my work, as well as the people who were with me in those moments. So here it goes:
            <br>
            <br>Thank you to my high-school friends for putting up with my absurd photo shoots and art projects. My sister for often being the subject of my endeavours in documentary photography. 
            My highschool art teacher for supporting my crazy art. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you to my first mentors in digital design in university and everyone who ever gave me a chance to tinker on their projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you to the radio station, CiTR 101.9 FM, and all the staff for teaching me and giving me the tools to podcast and make a radio show!
            Thank you to all the guests of my radio station, for letting me try it out. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you to the patient editors at the Ubyssey, for letting me write novice articles and pitch too many pitches. Thank you to my friends who I looped into these projects. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you to my bosses/supervisors who believed in me. Thank you to my community who has nurtured me.
            <br> 
            <br>
           Thank you to my friends for always cheering me on - no matter the endeavour. Thank you to my dog for always sticking with me in those late night projects and bringing joy to my life. Thank you to my uncles for 
           encouraging me to lean into my creativity, and feeding my imagination. And my parents for accepting and supporting who I have become. Thank you to my family for supporting me when I needed it the most.
